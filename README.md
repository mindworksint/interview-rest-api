## Build a REST API

1. Return a list of top posts ordered by the number of comments. Consume the API endpoints provided
	- Comments endpoint – https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
	- View Single Post endpoint – https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{post_id}
	- View All Posts endpoint – https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
	- The API response should have the following fields: 
		- post_id 
		- post_title
		- post_body 
		- total_number_of_comments

2. Search API 
Create an endpoint that allows a user to filter the comments based on all the available fields. Your solution needs to be scalable. 
	- comments endpoint – https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

## Additional

- You should build the API with code reusability, readability and maintainability in mind.
- You are also encouraged to show off knowledge in advance concepts in the framework/technology which the job position required within the confinement of the time and use cases of the test.

## Notes

- Once completed, send us a screenshot of your api response for Question 1 & 2. 
- Make your repo public, and send us the link for us to review
